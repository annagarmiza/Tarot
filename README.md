Tarot Reading Web App - On the making
FullStack project - mongoDB, nodeJS and react 
<br />
A digital tarot reading system. The tarot provides a glimpse into our inner self
world. The cards reflect our thoughts, emotions and help us to truly connect and understand ourselves.
<br />
<br />
Main Functionality:<br />
The interface allows the user to select the desired card spread and type an open-ended question to ask
the cards. Next, guides user through an intro and allows the user to shuffle the cards. Finally, the user
will choose from facedown cards. The system will allow the user to pick cards according to the spread
layout and will return to the user a complete card interpretation based on card selection.

Done ✅:
<br />
- Main Functionality - Full User Reading Experience <br />

Working on 👷‍♀️: <br />
- User management <br />
- Adding Redux <br />

Next:
- Reflection – an input field for the user to document feelings and thoughts that arise from the reading (for signed up user). <br />
- Reading History – Saving user’s reading and the relevant reflection (for signed up user).<br />
- Mirroring – analysis of past user’s reading according to different criteria and showing a mirroring report (for signed up user).<br />
- Tailor maid reading interpretation – returning an adjusted reading (love, career, wellbeing). For example, if the question includes ‘money’ – a financial answer will be       displayed. <br />
- Feedback – collecting user feedback after a reading (liked/disliked) in order to improved the digital response. <br />


Fixing 🛠: <br />
- Improving API calls in the code
