The Fool,0,0,Major,Trump,"[beginnings, freedom, innocence, originality, adventure, idealism, spontaneity]","The upright fool signifies calculated risk. It’s never too late to begin anew and follow your heart’s desire. The journey ahead is not without danger, but it is time to take a leap of faith. This card augers well for those embarking on new enterprises and educational courses, provided sensible planning is in place; this is a time for optimism and a fresh perspective. The Fool brings an opportunity to start over and feel young again or excited at the prospect of a new way of living; the Fool is an embodiment of your spirit, whether male or female, ready to explore and discover. Whatever you start now will go well, provided you do look before you leap—but once the decision is made, it’s time to push forward and not look back; have courage, commit to your path, and be fully in the moment. The Fool’s appearance in a reading can bring a sigh of relief, in that there is now a way ahead. Welcome in the new and travel lightly.",http://dodecahedroid.com/pcio-tarot/rwpop1910/rwfool.jpg
The Magician,I,1,Major,Trump,"[willpower, desire, being resourceful, skill, ability, concentration, manifestation]","It’s time for action—for communicating and expressing your ideas and desires. This is the card of the inventor, the traveler, the self-employed, and the entrepreneur, as it beckons you to broaden your horizons. You will have the drive to spur your plans forward, and, perhaps, to take new, creative approaches: to think laterally, ask questions, trust your internal guidance, and let go of procrastination. Blessed with a magic wand, you have the ability to transform whatever you choose, and in this way, the Magician is a very positive card in a reading. He directs you to make the most of your skills and talents and step into your power; focus on your projects and capitalize on your personal strengths. Spiritually, the Magician shows you connecting with your higher, or true, self and acting with pure intention. This card can also show a significant journey.",http://dodecahedroid.com/pcio-tarot/rwpop1910/rwmagician.jpg
